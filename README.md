# üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Fitness Membership Analytics Project

## üéØ Objective
This project was undertaken as part of the completion of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study** certificate on Coursera. The primary objective was to analyze gym membership data to derive insights into member demographics, subscription preferences, attendance patterns, and popular group lessons. The aim is to utilize these insights to make data-driven recommendations that could enhance member satisfaction and improve gym operations.

## üìä Data Source
I downloaded the dataset from **Kaggle**, which provided a comprehensive view of gym memberships, including member demographics, subscription types, attendance records, and preferences for group lessons.

## üõ†Ô∏è Data Cleaning Process
To ensure the accuracy and reliability of my analysis, I performed several data cleaning steps in **Microsoft Excel**:

1. **Removing Duplicates**: Checked for and removed any duplicate entries to maintain the uniqueness of records.
2. **Handling Missing Values**: Identified missing values and replaced them with appropriate placeholders or calculated averages where applicable.
3. **Data Type Correction**: Ensured all columns were formatted correctly (e.g., dates, numbers) for accurate analysis.
4. **Standardization**: Standardized text entries (e.g., "No Preference") for consistency across the dataset.
5. **Outlier Detection**: Analyzed the data for outliers that could distort my analysis and addressed them accordingly.

After cleaning the data, I uploaded it to **MySQL** for further analysis.

## üê¨ MySQL Analysis
In **MySQL**, I wrote various SQL queries to explore different categories and relationships within the data. This process solidified my understanding of SQL and improved my confidence in data querying. I created tables to aggregate and summarize data, allowing for a clearer analysis of gym membership trends.

## üìà Power BI Visualization
Next, I connected **Power BI** to my MySQL server to load the cleaned data for visualization. I created several interactive dashboards, including:

- **Gender Distribution of Members** (Pie Chart)
- **Subscription Type Breakdown** (Stacked Column Chart)
- **Popular Group Lessons** (Stacked Bar Chart)
- **Gym Attendance by Day** (Stacked Bar Chart)
- **Subscription Type by Gender** (Stacked Bar Chart)
- **Weekly Attendance Trend** (Line Chart)

Through these visualizations, I aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of gym membership dynamics.

## üìù Summary of Analysis
The dashboard presents the following key findings:

1. **Gender Distribution**: A balanced membership demographic with **49.7% male** and **50.3% female**.
2. **Subscription Types**: Slightly more members prefer **standard subscriptions** (507) over **premium** (493).
3. **Popular Group Lessons**: **BodyPump**, **XCore**, and **Yoga** are the most favored classes, indicating opportunities for expanded offerings.
4. **Attendance Patterns**: **Monday** has the highest attendance, while **Sunday** shows the lowest, suggesting potential for increased engagement on slower days.
5. **Subscription Type by Gender**: Insights into which genders prefer certain subscription types can guide targeted marketing strategies.
6. **Weekly Attendance Trend**: **Thursday** is the most attended day, indicating successful programming on that day.

## üí° Recommendations for Improvement
Based on the analysis, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Enhance Engagement Strategies**: Introduce more varied classes, especially on underperforming days, to attract a broader audience.
2. **Promote Premium Memberships**: Create targeted promotions to encourage standard members to consider premium subscriptions.
3. **Leverage Popular Classes**: Schedule more sessions of popular classes like BodyPump and Yoga to meet demand.
4. **Optimize Class Scheduling**: Analyze peak hours and adjust class offerings accordingly to maximize attendance.
5. **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement regular surveys to gather member feedback, helping refine offerings and improve satisfaction.
6. **Community Events**: Organize fitness challenges or open days to increase engagement and attract new members, particularly on quieter days.

## üöÄ Conclusion
This project allowed me to apply my data analysis skills in a practical scenario, enhancing my proficiency in Excel, SQL, and Power BI. The insights gained from the analysis can significantly impact gym operations and member satisfaction.
